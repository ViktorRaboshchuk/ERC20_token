# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
npx hardhat verify --network goerli --contract contracts/HomeToken.sol:HomeToken 0xB1a40cA5Bc1B814F8054cbdff9B7E997F65E7E00
npx hardhat test test/HomeTokenTests.ts --typecheck
```
